Mathematics is the classification and study of all possible patterns [(1)]. This
package includes common number functions related to querying *about* numbers,
*comparing* numbers, *rounding* numbers, performing *rounded division*,
performing *modulo* operations, *controlling range* of numbers, performing
*arithmetic* operations, obtaining *divisors* of a number (and related
operations), getting the number of possible *arrangements* of a set of objects,
performing *geometry*-related calculations, performing basic *statistical*
analysis, and finding various *statistical means*.

**Natural numbers**: There are 3 different ways of performing the *modulo*
operation: [rem], [mod], and [modp]. [gcd]/`HCF` and [lcm] of a list of numbers
can be obtained. To calculate the number of ways of *ordering items*, use
[factorial]/`P(n, k)`, [binomial]/`C(n, k)`, or [multinomial]/`n!/k‚ÇÅ!k‚ÇÇ!...`.

**Real numbers**: *Range* of a number can be controlled with [constrain],
[normalize], or [remap]. Use [lerp] for *linear interpolation* (or extrapolation);
[root] for calculating the *n-th root* of a number; and [log] to find the
*logarithm* of a number with a given base.

**Geometry**: Perform conversion from [degrees] to [radians] and vice versa.
Find the [magnitude] of a vector or [distance] between two points.

**Statistics**: For a list of numbers, we can calculate the [sum], [product],
[mean]. [median] gives the value lying in the middle when the numbers are
sorted, and [modes] gives the values which are repeated most often. The
difference between the largest and the smallest values is the [range].
[variance] is a measure of variability of numbers.

This package is available in both *Node.js* and *Web* formats. The web format is
exposed as `extra_math` standalone variable and can be loaded from [jsDelivr CDN].

math.sum(1, 2, 3, 4);
// ‚Üí 10

math.median(1, 7, 8);
